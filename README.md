# BinaryToDec

C++ Binary / Decimal Converter

Coded in VSCode

This code may be used by anyone, all I ask is that I am given credit should a part of my code be used. 

I am not responsible for any issues implementing this code may cause to other projects.

This converter will prompt the user to choose the type of conversion they wish to perform (ex. decimal to binary or binary to decimal).
Once a conversion type is selected the user will be prompted to enter the number they wish to convert, and they will be provided with the converted number.
After the conversion the user will then be asked if they would like to continue.
If yes the user will be provided with the initial prompt for conversion type. If no the program will terminate.


If you have any suggestions for features that can be added or questions about the code, please email me at: Apoctalypticname@gmail.com
Thank you for checking this out and I hope it's helpful!

Contents: BNumCheck.cpp - Contains the function "numCheck" that determines whether or not the provided number is binary using a vector.
Choice.cpp - Contains the function "choice" that receives the input from the initial prompt and runs the code as intended based off of the users input.
conversion.cpp - Contains two functions "binaryConv" (converts from decimal to binary) and "decConv" (converts from binary to decimal) which each will receive a number provided by the user and convert it to binary / decimal.
